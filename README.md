# SignSpeak ü§ü

> Real-time sign language to speech/text translation using AI

**Status:** üöß Work in Progress

## What is SignSpeak?

SignSpeak is an AI-powered application that translates sign language gestures into speech and text in real-time. Using computer vision and machine learning, it aims to bridge communication gaps and make conversations more accessible.

## Features (Planned)

- üìπ **Real-time Translation** - Live camera feed processing
- üé§ **Text-to-Speech** - Convert translations to audio
- üåê **Multi-language Support** - Support for different sign languages
- üì± **Cross-platform** - Web and mobile applications
- üîí **Privacy First** - Local processing when possible

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Socket.IO for real-time communication

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching

**AI/ML:**
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- OpenCV for computer vision
- MediaPipe for hand detection

## Current Status

This project is in early development. We're currently working on:

- [ ] Basic project setup
- [ ] Camera integration
- [ ] ML model development
- [ ] Real-time processing pipeline
- [ ] User interface design
